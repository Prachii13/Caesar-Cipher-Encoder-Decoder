# üîê Caesar Cipher Encoder/Decoder

A simple implementation of Caesar cipher encryption and decryption.

## How It Works
Each letter in the input text is shifted by a certain number (the key) through the alphabet. Non-alphabet characters remain unchanged.

## Example
- Text: "Hello World"
- Key: 3
- Encoded: "Khoor Zruog"
- Decoded (with same key): "Hello World"

## How to Run
```bash
python caesar_cipher.py
